<h1>MealRatingCoreData</h1>
<p>
  This simple iOS app lets the user rate a meal on a scale of 1 to 5. This is an update on the MealRater app and makes use of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The view controller layout which contains two TextFields, one button, and four labels
  </li>

  <li>
    One TextField will allow entering the name of the dish and the other the name of the restaurant
  </li>
  <li>
    The button will use a navigation controller to open a view controller that will allow the user to rate the meal on a 1 to 5 scale and then display that rating in a label
  </li>

  <li>
     The "Save" button saves the restaurant name, meal, and rating to Core Data and can load the data persistently when the app opens up after its been quit completely
  </li>
